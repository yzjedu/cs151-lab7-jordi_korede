The main objective of this lab was to continuing practice writing code that incorporates, multiple inputs from the user, math, and being able to print the desired output that the user wanted.
In addition, the purpose of the program was to output the cost of each room and the total cost. 
Also, I continued practicing writing algorithms and performing.
Furthermore, practicing the use of creating functions to simplify our code has been helpfully as the programs we continue to create for PA's and Labs will definitely get longer throughout the rest of the semester.
Our code was based on the algorithm that was written in order to solve the problem that the user had asked us to complete, which was to create a program that will output how much it will cost to re-do all the floors.
In addition, the concepts that we continue to explore was using math within our code to help the desired user complete some calculations.
We were able to get the results desired from the user. 
Also, we ran various tests to ensure that the program ran smoothly. 
The main challenge we ran into was just making sure that we were writing our algorithm correctly especially since we were more focused on a new aspect which was creating function.
So, that if someone to recreate our code, they would be able to understand it properly and that it makes sense to recreate. 
We ensured that we followed the 3 rules of programming by first listing the problem from the user, how we plan to solve, and then created an algorithm, so that we could create the userâ€™s desired program. 
In addition, I feel like I learned a deeper knowledge of how to use conditions and to make sure they are true for the output I need them. 
I enjoyed working with Korede, we had great chemistry which allowed for us to work together really well and complete this assignment smoothly.
